# Hotel Booking Cancelation Prediction

## In this notebook we will carry out a binary classification problem involving the probability of a hotel booking getting canceled. We will be Pipelining the data using a Heatmap to visualise the rows that contribute the most in the cancelation of the booking. For this Seaborn and Pandas will be used. SKLEARN is used to Normalize the data , TensorFlow and Keras.Sequential() is used for the creation of the Neural network.

Future Updates: One Hot encoding the Alphanumeric data , improve the model

Developer note: Loss curves have a gap
