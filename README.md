# Hotel Booking Cancelation Prediction

## In this notebook we will carry out a binary classification problem involving the probability of a hotel booking getting canceled. We will be Pipelining the data using a Heatmap to visualise the rows that contribute the most numerically in the cancelation of the booking. For this Seaborn and Pandas will be used. SKLEARN is used to Normalize the data , TensorFlow and Keras.Sequential() is used for the creation of the Neural network.

Future Updates: One Hot encoding the Alphanumeric data , improve the model , taking in account more feature(current: 12)

Developer note: Loss curves have a gap
